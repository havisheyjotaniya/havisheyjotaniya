# 👋 Hello & Namaste! I'm Havishey Jotaniya!

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a graduate student pursuing my MS in **Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology** (Expected May 2026).

I enjoy building intelligent, practical systems that merge **data, AI, and automation** — from scalable backend architectures to AI-driven applications that make life simpler.  

💡 My core interests include:  
- **Machine Learning & AI Systems** — LLMs, NLP, and deep learning applications.  
- **Backend Development** — Python, Flask, FastAPI, and REST API design.  
- **Data Engineering** — building ETL pipelines, automations, and analytics systems.  
- **Cloud & DevOps** — AWS, CI/CD, and Docker-based scalable deployments.  

🚀 I’ve recently worked on:  
- **AI Code Review Assistant** → Automating GitHub pull-request reviews using GPT models and static analysis.  
- **Personal AI Knowledge Assistant** → Building a private RAG-based knowledge retrieval system with GPT-4o and FAISS.  

I’m always exploring how **AI + Engineering** can enhance productivity, creativity, and knowledge management.  
If you’re working on something exciting in **AI, data systems, or intelligent tools**, I’d love to collaborate or chat!

## 🌟 Projects

###  AI Code Review Assistant  
- Built an AI-powered code review system integrating OpenAI GPT models with GitHub Actions to automate pull-request analysis and deliver contextual feedback on code quality, structure, and security.  
- Combined LLM reasoning with static analysis tools (Ruff, Bandit, Radon) to detect bugs, complexity issues, and vulnerabilities in real time.  
- Designed a modular Python backend with YAML configuration and a local test mode for scalable deployment across repositories.  
- Automated the review workflow via a CI/CD-ready GitHub pipeline, reducing manual review time by 35% and improving developer efficiency.  

###  Personal AI Knowledge Assistant  
- Developed an AI-powered personal assistant that retrieves, summarizes, and contextualizes user documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and OpenAI GPT-4o.  
- Implemented a semantic search pipeline with FAISS vector embeddings for accurate, citation-based responses.  
- Built an interactive web app using Streamlit and FastAPI, designed for privacy, local deployment, and real-time document querying.  
- Created a lightweight, intuitive architecture to manage and query personal and academic knowledge efficiently.
