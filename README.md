# 👋 Hello & Namaste! I'm Havishey Jotaniya!

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a graduate student pursuing my MS in **Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology** (GPA: 3.60, expected May 2026).  
I have 1 year of **Flutter/iOS development experience** and strong interests in **Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI applications**.  

I love solving real-world problems — from **analyzing airline passenger satisfaction** to **building fitness tracking apps** and **deep learning models for image classification**.

## 💼 Experience
- **Flutter Developer Intern @ PlusGold, Bangalore**  
  - Developed cross-platform mobile apps using Flutter (Dart).  
  - Integrated Firebase backend (authentication, database, real-time sync).  
  - Designed responsive UI/UX for multi-device use.  

- **Academic Projects @ Stevens**  
  - **Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis**  
    - Built ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, ANN, Gradient Boosting).  
    - Performed data cleaning, EDA, and model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).  
  - **Flask-based Fitness Tracker**  
    - Engineered a workout & calorie tracking app using Flask, SQLite, and REST APIs.  
    - Implemented authentication and analytics pipelines for real-time insights.
